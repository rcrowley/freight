# Freight

[![IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/buttons/irc.freenode.net/freight.png)](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#freight)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/freight-team/freight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/freight-team/freight)

A modern take on the Debian archive.

This repository has been forked (in the traditional sense of the word) from
Richard Crowley's [freight](https://github.com/rcrowley/freight) repository. A
fork had become necessary because the main project was not actively maintained
and serious issues had started to crop up. While fixes and improvements were
available in various freight GitHub forks, they were not merged to the main
project. This fork and the associated GitHub organization,
[freight-team](https://github.com/freight-team), attempts to fix these issues.

## Usage

Install Freight and create a minimal configuration in `/usr/local/etc/freight.conf` or `/etc/freight.conf` as appropriate containing the name of your GPG key:

	GPG="example@example.com"

Add packages to particular distros:

	freight add foobar_1.2.3-1_all.deb apt/squeeze apt/lucid apt/natty

Build the cache of all the files needed to be accepted as a Debian archive:

	freight cache

If your system has GnuPG 2.x make sure that a gpg-agent is running and that you 
have installed a pinentry package (e.g. pinentry-curses) that suits your needs. 
On freight 0.3.11 and older you may also need to set the GPG_TTY environment 
variable like this:

    export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

Serve `/var/cache/freight` via your favorite web server and install it as an APT source:

	echo "deb http://example.com $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/example.list
	sudo wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/example.gpg http://example.com/keyring.gpg
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get -y install foobar

Make sure your webserver is configured to follow symlinks inside of the hosted directory. 

## Installation

### From source

	git clone git://github.com/freight-team/freight.git
	cd freight && make && sudo make install

### From a Debian archive

	wget -O - https://swupdate.openvpn.net/repos/repo-public.gpg|sudo apt-key add -
	echo "deb http://build.openvpn.net/debian/freight_team $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/freight.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get -y install freight

### From a custom-made Debian package

You need `build-essential` package installed. Clone the freight repository, build a package and install it:

	git clone git://github.com/freight-team/freight.git
	cd freight && dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b
	sudo dpkg -i ../freight_<version>-<build>_all.deb

### From Fedora/EPEL repositories

EL users must first [configure EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F).

	yum -y install freight
